# AnimalClassification

## Overview
The **AnimalClassification** project is a deep learning-based image classification model designed to identify different animal species from images. This project leverages TensorFlow and pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16) to achieve high accuracy in classifying animal categories.

## Features
- Supports multiple animal classes (e.g., cat, cow, elephant, sheep, squirrel).
- Uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction.
- Provides easy integration with Flask/Streamlit for web-based or desktop applications.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Flask or Streamlit (optional, for deployment)

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
Place your dataset in the `Images/` directory. Each class should have its own subdirectory containing relevant images. Example:
```
Images/
├── cat/
├── cow/
├── elephant/
├── sheep/
└── squirrel/
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/AnimalClassification.git
   cd AnimalClassification
   ```

2. Train the model (optional):
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000` (if using Flask).

## Results
The model is capable of classifying images into the following categories:
- Cat
- Cow
- Elephant
- Sheep
- Squirrel

Example output:
```
Input Image: test_image.jpg
Predicted Class: Cat
Confidence: 94.3%
```

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the dataset to include more animal species.
- Improve the model's accuracy with additional training.
- Add support for real-time predictions using a webcam.
